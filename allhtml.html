        Why is it called CSS?
        The cascade lies at the core of CSS, as emphasized by the name: Cascading Style Sheets. When a selector matches
        an element, the property value from the origin with the highest precedence gets applied, even if the selector
        from a lower precedence origin or layer has greater specificity

            Key differences between Java and JavaScript: Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP
            scripting language. Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code
            is run on a browser only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.
            JavaScript has seven built-in types: null , undefined , boolean , number , string , object , and symbol .
            They can be identified by the typeof operator.
