        <h1> Q.1 WHAT IS HTML?</h1>
        <h2>Answer: HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web
            pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell
            the browser how to display the content.

        <h2>Q.2 WHAT IS IMAGE TAG?</h2>
        <h3> Answer: The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. Images are not technically inserted into a
            web page; images are linked to web pages. The <img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.
            The <img> tag has two required attributes: src - Specifies the path to the image.

            <h2>Q.3 WHAT ARE HEADING TAG?</h2>
            <h3> Answer: HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph
                breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are
                H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least.
